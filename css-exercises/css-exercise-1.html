            <p>The Degree Programme in Business Information Technology provides students with practical professional Business IT skills combined with an extensive theoretical base. We offer to our students courses on the most interesting areas of current IT education. The areas are: Digital services, Software engineering, ICT-infrastructures and IT security, and Business development and Business IT solutions. <br> Most of the Bachelor's degree programmes as well as the Master's degree programme in International Business Management will introduce the SAT test as an alternative to entrance examinations from 2018 onwards. This new alternative will offer applicants a faster and more convenient application experience.</p>

            <p>In addition, studies typically include content and practical application arranged in co-operation with partnering IT and other companies. This collaboration with both local and international companies is an integral part of the programme and enables students to learn the skills and acquire the experience to work in multicultural teams and on multinational projects.
            Career plans that include the development of entrepreneurship, and sales and service abilities are strongly supported. Furthermore, the programme offers general courses enhancing other skills required to successfully work in a business environment. These skills are related to areas such as team work, communication, and the ability to work independently.</p>
